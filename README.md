#My résumé

Because LaTeX is fun. Kinda. Also, it only makes sense to not only see
how the contents of it change, but what crazy technology I choose for
creating it.

Right now, I'm creating it with vim and
[MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/). So I just escape from edit mode,
fire off `!pdflatex %` and, bam! I have my neat résumé in pdf.
